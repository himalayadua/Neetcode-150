# Example 1:
Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,0,8]
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.

# Approach 1: Iterative Solution with Carry
Let's assume these are simple number additions.
- One approach to solve this problem is to 
    - iterate through the linked lists, 
    - adding the corresponding digits and 
    - keeping track of the carry. 
We create a new linked list to store the result digits, starting from the head. 
If the sum is greater than 9, we update the carry and append the least significant digit to the result linked list. Finally, if there is a remaining carry, we append it as a new node to the result linked list.


```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def addTwoNumbers(l1, l2):
    dummy_head = ListNode()
    current = dummy_head
    carry = 0

    while l1 or l2 or carry:
        sum_val = carry

        if l1:
            sum_val += l1.val
            l1 = l1.next
        if l2:
            sum_val += l2.val
            l2 = l2.next

        carry = sum_val // 10
        current.next = ListNode(sum_val % 10)
        current = current.next

    return dummy_head.next
```
