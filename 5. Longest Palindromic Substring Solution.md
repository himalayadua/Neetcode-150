# Approach 1:

- palindrome mirrors around its center
- possible palindrome
    - "abba"
    - "aba"
- variables to store the longest palindromic substring found -> `pstring`
- loop through all possible center indices in the string
    - simple loop through all chars of string
    - for each center
        - expand both sides
        - check left char with right char
- if they match, keep expanding
- until either
    - left pointer >= 0
    - or right pointer = len(original string) 
    - or left char != right char

- compare pallindrome found with `pstring`
    - update `pstring` with it if it's longer
    - compare length
