# Two Pointers technique
The Two Pointers technique is a commonly used concept 
- used in solving array and linked list problems
- involves using two pointers that 
- traverse the data structure simultaneously, 
    - usually starting from different positions 
    - or moving at different speeds

> By moving the pointers strategically, you can often solve the problem in linear time complexity (O(n)) instead of using nested loops, which would lead to quadratic time complexity (O(n^2)).

To identify if a question can be solved using the Two Pointers technique, look for the following characteristics:
- The problem involves 
    - searching, 
    - comparing, or 
    - processing elements in an `array` or `linked list`.
- The data structure is `sorted` or has some specific order or pattern.
- The problem requires 
    - finding pairs, 
    - subarrays, or 
    - subsequences that satisfy certain conditions.

## Let's consider an example problem: 
**"Given a sorted array of integers, find two numbers that sum up to a target value."**

To solve this problem using the Two Pointers technique:

1. Initialize two pointers, "left" and "right," pointing to the start and end of the array, respectively.
2. While the left pointer is less than the right pointer, do the following:
   a. Calculate the sum of the numbers at the left and right pointers.
   b. If the sum is equal to the target value, you have found the pair. Return the indices or values as required.
   c. If the sum is less than the target value, increment the left pointer to consider a larger number.
   d. If the sum is greater than the target value, decrement the right pointer to consider a smaller number.
3. Repeat steps 2 until the pointers meet or cross each other, indicating that no pair satisfies the condition.

By using two pointers and manipulating their positions based on the sum, we can efficiently find the pair of numbers that sum up to the target value in a sorted array.

The presence of a sorted array and the requirement to find a pair satisfying a specific condition are indicators that the Two Pointers technique might be applicable. Look for similar patterns in LeetCode questions to identify when this technique can be employed.
