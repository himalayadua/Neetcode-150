# Two Pointers technique
The Two Pointers technique is a commonly used concept 
- used in solving array and linked list problems
- involves using two pointers that 
- traverse the data structure simultaneously, 
    - usually starting from different positions 
    - or moving at different speeds

> By moving the pointers strategically, you can often solve the problem in linear time complexity (O(n)) instead of using nested loops, which would lead to quadratic time complexity (O(n^2)).

To identify if a question can be solved using the Two Pointers technique, look for the following characteristics:
- The problem involves 
    - searching, 
    - comparing, or 
    - processing elements in an `array` or `linked list`.
- The data structure is `sorted` or has some specific order or pattern.
- The problem requires 
    - finding pairs, 
    - subarrays, or 
    - subsequences that satisfy certain conditions.

## Let's consider an example problem: 
**"Given a sorted array of integers, find two numbers that sum up to a target value."**

To solve this problem using the Two Pointers technique:

1. Initialize two pointers, "left" and "right," pointing to the start and end of the array, respectively.

2. While the (i < j) left pointer is less than the right pointer, do the following:
   a. Calculate the sum of the numbers at the left and right pointers.
   b. If the sum is equal to the target value, you have found the pair. Return the indices or values as required.
   c. If the sum is less than the target value, increment the left pointer to consider a larger number.
   d. If the sum is greater than the target value, decrement the right pointer to consider a smaller number.
3. Repeat steps 2 until the pointers meet or cross each other, indicating that no pair satisfies the condition.


## Identifying the appropriate time to use the Two Pointers approach 
Requires careful analysis of the problem statement:
- Target Data Structure
    - arrays and linked lists
- Sorting Order or Pattern
    - data structure may have a specific order or pattern that can be leveraged
    - Look for keywords like `"sorted," "consecutive," or "distinct"` in the problem statement
- Element Comparison
    - problem involves making decisions based on comparisons between elements, Two Pointers can be a good fit. 
    - For example, `finding pairs`, `subarrays`, or subsequences that satisfy certain conditions.


## Common pitfalls and challenges
Being aware of these challenges can help you avoid mistakes and improve your implementation. Here are some key pitfalls to keep in mind:
- Incorrect Pointer Initialization
    - initialize the pointers correctly at the start
    - their initial positions can significantly impact the algorithm's correctness and efficiency
- Pointer Movement Conditions
    - Carefully define the conditions for advancing the pointers
    - Incorrect conditions may lead to an infinite loop or skipping necessary elements. 
    - Consider all possible scenarios and ensure the pointers progress properly through the data structure.
- Handling Edge Cases
    - Be mindful of edge cases such as 
        - empty arrays or lists, 
        - single-element structures, or 
        - scenarios where the pointers may go out of bounds. 
- Problem Constraints
    - Pay close attention to any constraints or conditions mentioned in the problem statement. 
    - Some problems may have additional restrictions on pointer movements
- Overlapping or Non-Overlapping Pointers
    - Determine whether your problem requires overlapping or non-overlapping pointers.
