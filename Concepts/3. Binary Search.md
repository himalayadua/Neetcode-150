# Binary Search 
Widely used algorithmic technique for searching for a specific target value within a sorted array or list. 
- follows a divide-and-conquer approach
- repeatedly dividing the search space in half 
    - until the target value is found or determined to be absent. 
- key idea is to 
    - compare the target value with the middle element of the array 
    - and narrow down the search space based on the result of the comparison

## Determine if a question can be solved using the Binary Search technique
Look for the following characteristics:
1. Sorted Data
    - The array or list should be sorted in ascending or descending order
    - Binary Search `relies on the sorted nature of the data` to efficiently navigate through the search space.

2. Efficient Search Requirement: 
    - problem should involve searching for a specific target value 
    - or finding a certain condition within the sorted array


To identify if a LeetCode question can be solved using Binary Search, carefully read the problem statement and look for indications of sorted data or efficient search requirements. Keywords such as "sorted array," "search," "find," or "target value" often hint at the potential use of Binary Search. 

## Let's consider an example problem: 
**"Given a sorted array of integers and a target value, return the index of the target value if it exists in the array, or -1 if it is not present."**

To solve this problem using Binary Search:

- Initialize two pointers
    - "left" and "right," 
    - pointing to the start and end of the array, respectively
- While `(left <= right)` the left pointer is less than or equal to the right pointer, do the following:
   - Calculate the middle index 
        - middle = average of the left and right pointers.
   - Compare the value at the middle index with the target value
        - If the middle value is equal to the target, return the middle index.
        - If the middle value is greater than the target, update the right pointer to be one position before the middle index.
        - If the middle value is less than the target, update the left pointer to be one position after the middle index.
- If the target is not found after the loop ends
    - return -1 to indicate its absence in the array


## Binary Search algorithm in Python:

```python
def binary_search(nums, target):
    left = 0
    right = len(nums) - 1

    while left <= right:
        middle = (left + right) // 2

        if nums[middle] == target:
            return middle
        elif nums[middle] < target:
            left = middle + 1
        else:
            right = middle - 1

    return -1
```

### Implementation
- the `binary_search` function takes in 
    - a sorted list `nums` and 
    - a target value `target`
- Initializes 
    - the left pointer `left` to 0 and 
    - the right pointer `right` to the last index of the list. 
- Enters a while loop that 
    - continues until the left pointer is less than or equal to the right pointer
    - calculates the middle index `middle` 
        - using `(left + right) // 2`. 
    - compares the element at the middle index with the target value. 
    - If they are equal, it returns the middle index as the result. 
    - If the middle value is less than the target, it updates the left pointer to `middle + 1` to search the right half of the remaining list. 
    - If the middle value is greater than the target, it updates the right pointer to `middle - 1` to search the left half of the remaining list.

- If the target value is not found after the loop ends, it returns -1 to indicate its absence in the list.
