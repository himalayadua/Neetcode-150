# Prefix Sum 
Technique used to efficiently compute and analyze cumulative sums of elements in an array. 
It involves creating an auxiliary array where each element represents the sum of all elements up to that point in the original array. This allows for quick calculations of range sums and facilitates solving various algorithmic problems efficiently.

## Let's consider an example 
**Suppose you have an array of numbers: [4, -2, 6, 7, 1, 3]. We want to compute the cumulative sums of this array using the Prefix Sum technique.**

1. Initialize an auxiliary array, let's call it prefixSum, of the same length as the original array, filled with zeroes: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].

2. Compute the cumulative sums by iterating over the original array and updating the prefixSum array accordingly:

   - Start with prefixSum[0] = originalArray[0].
   - For each subsequent index i (starting from 1), update prefixSum[i] as prefixSum[i-1] + originalArray[i].

   Applying this process to our example array, we get:
   - prefixSum[0] = originalArray[0] = 4.
   - prefixSum[1] = prefixSum[0] + originalArray[1] = 4 + (-2) = 2.
   - prefixSum[2] = prefixSum[1] + originalArray[2] = 2 + 6 = 8.
   - prefixSum[3] = prefixSum[2] + originalArray[3] = 8 + 7 = 15.
   - prefixSum[4] = prefixSum[3] + originalArray[4] = 15 + 1 = 16.
   - prefixSum[5] = prefixSum[4] + originalArray[5] = 16 + 3 = 19.

   Therefore, the prefixSum array for the given original array is: [4, 2, 8, 15, 16, 19].

## How to recognize when the Prefix Sum technique can be applied to solve a problem efficiently. 
Here are some indicators:

- Range Sum Queries
    - If the problem involves computing the sum of elements within a specific range multiple times, the Prefix Sum technique can be useful. 
    - By precomputing the prefix sums, we can answer range sum queries in constant time complexity.

- Subarray Problems
    - problem requires analyzing contiguous subarrays and 
    - their properties (e.g., maximum sum, minimum sum, average)

> By precomputing the prefix sums, we can reduce time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n).

## Back to our example
Let's consider the problem of finding the maximum sum of a subarray within a given array. 
This problem can be efficiently solved using the Prefix Sum technique:

1. Initialize two variables: maxSum = 0 and currentSum = 0.

2. Iterate over the array and update the currentSum and maxSum as follows:

   - For each element in the array:
     - Update currentSum as currentSum + element.
     - If currentSum is negative, reset it to 0 (since a negative sum won't contribute to the maximum sum).
     - If currentSum is greater than maxSum, update maxSum with the currentSum.

At the end of the iteration, maxSum will contain the maximum sum of a subarray within the given array.

Using the example array [4, -2, 6, 7, 1, 3]:

- Iteration 1: element = 4
  - currentSum = 0 + 4 = 4
  - maxSum = 4

- Iteration 2: element = -2
  - currentSum = 4 + (-2) = 2
  - maxSum = 4

- Iteration 3: element = 6
  - currentSum = 2 + 6 = 8
  - maxSum = 8

- Iteration 4: element = 7
  - currentSum = 8 + 7 = 15
  - maxSum = 15

- Iteration 5: element = 1
  - currentSum = 15 + 1 = 16
  - maxSum = 16

- Iteration 6: element = 3
  - currentSum = 16 + 3 = 19

Therefore, the maximum sum of a subarray within the given array is 19.


## One more example 
**LeetCode problem 53** 
"Maximum Subarray Sum" problem statement is as follows:

Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) that has the largest sum and return its sum.

**Example:**
Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]

Output: 6

Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.


**Solution**
follow the steps described earlier:

1. Initialize two variables: `maxSum` and `currentSum` to 0.

2. Iterate over the array and update `currentSum` and `maxSum` as follows:

   - For each element in the array:
     - Update `currentSum` as `currentSum + element`.
     - If `currentSum` is negative, reset it to 0 (since a negative sum won't contribute to the maximum sum).
     - If `currentSum` is greater than `maxSum`, update `maxSum` with the `currentSum`.

3. Return `maxSum` as the result.

Let's apply this approach to the given example: `[-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]`:

- Iteration 1: element = -2
  - `currentSum` = 0 + (-2) = -2
  - `maxSum` = 0

- Iteration 2: element = 1
  - `currentSum` = -2 + 1 = -1
  - `maxSum` = 0

- Iteration 3: element = -3
  - `currentSum` = -1 + (-3) = -4
  - `maxSum` = 0

- Iteration 4: element = 4
  - `currentSum` = -4 + 4 = 0
  - `maxSum` = 4

- Iteration 5: element = -1
  - `currentSum` = 0 + (-1) = -1
  - `maxSum` = 4

- Iteration 6: element = 2
  - `currentSum` = -1 + 2 = 1
  - `maxSum` = 4

- Iteration 7: element = 1
  - `currentSum` = 1 + 1 = 2
  - `maxSum` = 4

- Iteration 8: element = -5
  - `currentSum` = 2 + (-5) = -3
  - `maxSum` = 4

- Iteration 9: element = 4
  - `currentSum` = -3 + 4 = 1
  - `maxSum` = 4

Therefore, the maximum subarray sum within the given array is 4.

**Time complexity** of this solution is O(n)
where n is the length of the input array.
