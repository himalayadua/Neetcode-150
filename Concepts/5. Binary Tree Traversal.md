# Binary tree traversal 
- refers to the process of visiting each node in a binary tree exactly once in a specific order
- fundamental concept in tree-based data structures and algorithms

## Three commonly used methods for binary tree traversal:

1. **In-order traversal**: 
    - left subtree is visited first
    - followed by the root node 
    - and then the right subtree
    - for a binary tree node
        - visits its left child, 
        - then itself, and 
        - finally its right child

2. **Pre-order traversal**: 
    - visits the root node first
    - followed by the left subtree
    - and then the right subtree
    - for a binary tree node
        - visit the node itself, 
        - then its left child, and 
        - finally its right child

3. **Post-order traversal**: 
    - the left subtree is visited first
    - then the right subtree, and 
    - finally the root node
    - for a binary tree node
        - visit its left child, 
        - then its right child, and 
        - finally the node itself.

## Let's consider an example
Suppose you have a binary tree as follows:

```
        1
       / \
      2   3
     / \
    4   5
```

to solve a problem 
    - requires visiting each node in a specific order
    - you may need to print the values of the nodes in pre-order traversal
    - the expected output for the above tree would be: 
        - 1, 2, 4, 5, 3. 
    - visiting the nodes in the order of `root, left subtree, and right subtree`

To implement pre-order traversal, you can use recursion or an iterative approach with a stack. Here's an example of how you can implement pre-order traversal in Python:

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

def pre_order_traversal(node):
    if node is None:
        return
    
    print(node.value)  # Process the node

    pre_order_traversal(node.left)  # Traverse left subtree
    pre_order_traversal(node.right)  # Traverse right subtree

# Construct the binary tree from the example
root = Node(1)
root.left = Node(2)
root.right = Node(3)
root.left.left = Node(4)
root.left.right = Node(5)

# Perform pre-order traversal
pre_order_traversal(root)
```

The output of this code will be: 1, 2, 4, 5, 3.
