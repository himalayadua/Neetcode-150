# Depth-First Search (DFS)
- graph traversal algorithm 
- explores a graph by visiting as far as possible along each branch before backtracking
- starts at a given node
    - explores as far as possible along each branch, and 
    - backtracks only when it reaches a dead end

## Understand if a particular question can be solved using DFS
Look for certain characteristics in the problem statement:

1. Search for All Paths
    - problem requires finding all possible paths 
    - or exploring all nodes in a graph

2. Depth-First Traversal
    - problem involves traversing a graph in a depth-first manner

3. Recursive Structure: 
    - problem has a recursive structure

> A BST is a binary tree where for each node, its left subtree contains only nodes with values less than the node's value, and its right subtree contains only nodes with values greater than the node's value.

## Example
**you are given a binary tree and asked to determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST)**
To solve this problem using DFS you can 
    - perform an in-order traversal of the binary tree, 
    - keeping track of the previously visited node
    - If at any point the current node's value is less than or equal to the previously visited node's value
    - it indicates that the tree is not a valid BST.

implementation in Python:

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def isValidBST(root):
    def dfs(node, lower=float('-inf'), upper=float('inf')):
        if not node:
            return True
        
        if node.val <= lower or node.val >= upper:
            return False
        
        return dfs(node.left, lower, node.val) and dfs(node.right, node.val, upper)
    
    return dfs(root)
```

In this example
    - the `dfs` function performs the DFS traversal
    - takes three parameters
        - the current node, 
        - the lower bound (representing the maximum value allowed in the left subtree), and 
        - the upper bound (representing the minimum value allowed in the right subtree)
    - If the current node violates the BST property
        - the function returns `False`. 
    - Else it recursively calls itself for the left and right subtrees, adjusting the bounds accordingly
