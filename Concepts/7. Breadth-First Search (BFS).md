# Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- graph traversal algorithm 
- explores all the vertices of a graph 
    - in breadth-first order
    - visits all the vertices at the same level 
    - before moving to the next level
- starts at a given source vertex and 
    - explores all the vertices connected to it 
    - before moving on to the next level of vertices.

Here's how BFS works:
1. Start by enqueueing the source vertex into a queue and mark it as visited.
2. While the queue is not empty, dequeue a vertex from the front of the queue.
3. Explore all the adjacent vertices of the dequeued vertex that have not been visited yet.
   - Enqueue each unvisited adjacent vertex into the queue and mark it as visited.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the queue becomes empty.

BFS is often used 
-  to find the shortest path between two vertices in an unweighted graph
- it explores vertices in increasing order of their distance from the source vertex
- used to solve a variety of other problems
    - finding connected components, 
    - detecting cycles, or 
    - traversing a tree level by level.

To determine if a particular question can be solved using BFS, you can look for certain characteristics in the problem statement:
1. The problem involves finding the shortest path or exploring all nodes within a certain distance from a given node.
2. The problem is framed in terms of levels or layers, such as finding the minimum number of steps required to reach a target.
3. The problem can be modeled as a graph or a tree structure, where nodes are connected in some way.

## Let's consider an example 
Suppose you are given a grid representing a maze
- where 'S' represents the starting position, 
- 'E' represents the exit, 
- '#' represents walls that cannot be traversed, and 
- '.' represents open paths
You need to find the minimum number of steps required to reach the exit from the starting position, moving only vertically or horizontally.

Example maze:
```
S . . . . . .
. # # . # . .
. . . . . . .
. # . # . # .
. . . . . # .
. # # # # # .
. . . . . E .
```

To solve this problem using BFS, you can follow these steps:
1. Start by enqueuing the starting position into a queue and mark it as visited.
2. While the queue is not empty, dequeue a position from the front of the queue.
3. Explore all the adjacent positions of the dequeued position that are valid and have not been visited yet.
   - Enqueue each valid unvisited position into the queue and mark it as visited, storing its distance from the starting position.
4. If an adjacent position is the exit ('E'), return its distance from the starting position.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the queue becomes empty.
6. If the queue becomes empty and the exit is not found, return -1 or any other appropriate value indicating that the exit is unreachable.

In the given maze
- the shortest path from 'S' to 'E' is 12 steps
- by applying BFS, you would visit the positions in the following order:
```
S . . . . . .
. # # . # . .
. 1 2 3 4 5 .
. # 4 # 6 # .
. 5 6 7 8 # .
. # # # # # .
. . . . . E .
```
The numbers represent the distance from the starting position 'S'.


# Example of a LeetCode problem
"Word Ladder." The problem is as follows:

Given two words, beginWord and endWord, and a word list of unique words, find the length of the shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord. You can modify one character at a time in a word, and all the intermediate words must exist in the word list. If there is no such transformation sequence, return 0.

For example, given:
beginWord = "hit"
endWord = "cog"
wordList = ["hot", "dot", "dog", "lot", "log", "cog"]

The shortest transformation sequence from "hit" to "cog" is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog", which has a length of 5.

To solve this problem efficiently using BFS, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a set to store the words in the word list for quick lookup.
2. Create a queue for BFS traversal and enqueue the beginWord into the queue.
3. Create a distance variable and initialize it to 1.
4. While the queue is not empty, dequeue a word from the front of the queue.
5. Generate all possible intermediate words by changing each character of the dequeued word and check if they exist in the word list.
6. If an intermediate word is equal to the endWord, return the current distance + 1.
7. Enqueue each valid intermediate word into the queue and remove it from the word list to avoid revisiting.
8. Repeat steps 4-7 until the queue becomes empty.
9. If the queue becomes empty and the endWord is not found, return 0 to indicate that no transformation sequence exists.

By applying BFS to the given example, the shortest transformation sequence from "hit" to "cog" would be found, and its length would be returned.

BFS is an effective approach for solving this problem because it explores the word ladder in a breadth-first manner, guaranteeing that the first occurrence of the endWord will be reached with the minimum number of transformations.
