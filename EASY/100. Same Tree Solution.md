# Solution
We'll use recursion to perform a depth-first search of both trees and compare the nodes, p and q, at each step. This recursive algorithm has three base cases:

1.  Are both p and q None? If so, then return True. This is because this only happens when we've reached the end of a branch, and all the nodes so far have matched.

If that wasn't true, then now we know that either p or q is a Node. But are they both nodes or is only one of them None? This leads to the second base case:

2.  Is either p or q None? If so, then return False, since that means one of them is None and one of them is a node, and those are clearly different from each other.

If that wasn't true, then at this point we know that both p and q are nodes, so let's compare their values:

3.  Are the values of p and q different? If so, return False.

If that wasn't true, then at this point we know that both p and q are nodes and their values are the same. So then we make two recursive calls. We'll pass in `p.left` and `q.left` for the first call to check the left subtree, and pass in `p.right` and `q.right` for the right subtree. For a visualization of the recursion, please see the video. But the idea is that both left subtrees and right subtrees must be the same, which is why the two recursive calls are connected with an `and`.
