# Approach 1:
Steps:
- Create a data structure unique values: set, or array. 
- a flag variable to store False.
- Iterate through the array: using a loop logic.
- Check for duplicates: match against the store created in step 1.
- Add unique elements to the set: if no match found, add it to the store. if match is found, set flag variable to True and return.
- Return false if no duplicates are found: if no duplicates encountered, return flag variable.

### Complexity

    Time complexity: O(n)
    Space complexity: O(n)



# Approach 2:
using set's in built functionality
- set(list) = removes duplicates
- if there were duplicates, then the len(set(list)) will be less than len(list)
