# Approach 1:
Steps:
- we need unique elements
- create a set
- variable:`longest` = 0, `currentNum`, `currentLen`= 0
- loop all elements of set
- if i-1 wasn't in set
    - currentNum = i
    - currentLen = 1
    - while currentNum+1 in set
        - currentNum += 1
        - currentLen += 1
    - longest = max of (longest) , (currentLen)

# Approach 2: Dynamic Programming
- Break down the problem
- for each number, we are checking if next number is in the set
- this code replaced by DP
- each existance is credited value = 1
- check next number recursively

Steps:
- create a set
- func dp(i)
    - if i isn't in set return 0
    - return 1 + dp(i+1)
- loop through all numbers in `nums`
    - longest = max(longest, dp(n))
