# Approach 1:
Thoughts:
- difficult to manage 3 indices
- use a loop
    - `i` becomes one index that fixed for the iteration of the loop
    - then we move around the 2 indices
[-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
  i j         k
- numbers can be +ve and -ve
- which index should we move?
    - sorted array could help
    - then we know if moving j or k is required
    - sum required is 0, and both j and k are in +ve
    - then no more moves.. :)
