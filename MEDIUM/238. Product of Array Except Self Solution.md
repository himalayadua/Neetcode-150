# Approach 1: Worst
Steps:
- answer = []
- loop1: i = current value from `nums`
    - result = 1
    - loop2: where i != j
        - result = result * j
    - answer[i] = result
- return answer


# Approach 2:
> Instructions in Question:
>> You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time and without using the division operation.
Thoughts:
- `O(n)` means only one loop
- so as we go through each element (i)
    - we pickup everything to the left of i
    - we pickup everything to the right of i
- Calculate leftProduct
- Calculate rightProduct
- Multiply the corresponding elements from the leftProduct and rightProduct


Steps:
- Variables
    - left = array size of `nums`
    - right = array size of `nums`
    - result = array size of `nums`
- loop 1 to n
    - left[0] = 1
    - left[1] = left[0] * nums[0]
    - left[2] = left[1] * nums[1]
    - so starting with nums = [1,2,3,4]
    - we get left = [1, 1, 2, 6]
- loop n-2 to -1: step -1
    - right[3] = 1
    - right[2] = right[3] * nums[3]
    - right[1] = right[2] * nums[2]
- loop 1 to n
    - res[i] = left[i] * right[i]
