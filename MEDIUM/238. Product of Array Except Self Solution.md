# Approach 1: Worst
Steps:
- answer = []
- loop1: i = current value from `nums`
    - result = 1
    - loop2: where i != j
        - result = result * j
    - answer[i] = result
- return answer


# Approach 2:
> Instructions in Question:
>> You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time and without using the division operation.
Thoughts:
- `O(n)` means only one loop
- so as we go through each element (i)
    - we pickup everything to the left of i
    - we pickup everything to the right of i
- Calculate leftProduct
- Calculate rightProduct
- Multiply the corresponding elements from the leftProduct and rightProduct


Steps:
- Variables
    - leftProduct
    - rightProduct
    - result
