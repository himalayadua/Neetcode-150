# Approach 1:
Thoughts:
- Encode
    - input ["poke", "mon"]
    - output "pokemon"
    - encode process looks fine
- Decode
    - input "pokemon"
    - expected output ["poke", "mon"]
    - how would the code know where the first word finished and 2nd started
- introduce delimiter in Encode process
    - poke#mon
    - poke;:mon
    - 4#poke3#mon
        - 4 is len of "poke"
        - 3 is len of "mon"

Steps:
- Encode
    - `result` variable
    - loop through input list
    - result = result + len(s) + "#" + s

- Decode
    - `result` list variable
    - loop: i = 0 to len(s)
        - look for first # 
        - j = position of # - 1
        - so the number between i and j
            - is the length of next word
        - starting position i = j + 1
        - last char of the word j = j + length
        - result.append[s[i:j]]
        - i = j
