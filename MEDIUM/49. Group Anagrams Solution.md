# Approach 1:
Expectation:
**Input:** strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
**Output:** [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]

Steps:
- the output looks like a map
- loop through the `strs` list
    - current value becomes the KEY
    - since the order of letters are different, we first sort the chars
- append them into the dict
    - key = KEY
    - value = current value in loop
